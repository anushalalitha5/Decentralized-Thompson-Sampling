# Decentralized-Thompson-Sampling

Code for simulations comparing decentralized Thompson Sampling algorithm's (proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10569.pdf)) performance with prior work. Experiments studying the effect of the number of agents and network topology on per-agent cumulative regret. Experiments to simulate decentralized Thompson Sampling algorithm under gossip protocol and over time-varying networks, where each communication link has a fixed probability of failing.
